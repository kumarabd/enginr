The Theme supports both Light and Dark Style!

## Licence

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). You can do anything you want, including projects for your clients, as long as you mention an attribution back (credit links in footer). See the [Licence](https://github.com/kumarabd/kumarabd.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE) file

I understand that sometimes footer links or any links to external websites are not convenient, so you have the option to remove credits/footer links by becoming a [Backer](https://opencollective.com/devlopr-jekyll#backer).
